Description about the Project :

The following task is for designing the Candidate-Registration-and-Admin-Panel -
I have used key Library feature like Bootstrap 5 , to design the complete responsive wep application .
There will be "HOMEPAGE" page , where the candidate can registere himself by filling all the required feilds and later clicking the REGISTER button .
IN the Hompage all the validations like name cannot contain special characters,age cannot contain negative numbers and email should conatin email-id format. (All the feilds in the form cannot be Empty).
There is an another button for the Admin .- where he redirects to the "ADMIN PAGE ".
In the ADMIN PAGE - when admin successfully logs in he will be redirected to other PAGE called "UserData.php".
In the "USERDATA.php" the admin have access to see the number of registered users.
Javascript is been used for a smooth process of redirecting websites using "set timeout () " .
Jquery has been used for the form validations .
As PHP takes a key role in the entire process of designing the web application - a)redirecting to webpages b) sessions c)connectivity to the Postgresql Database d)securing the passwords .
Postgresql database for storing the Candidate details , Job applications and the admin login credentials .
